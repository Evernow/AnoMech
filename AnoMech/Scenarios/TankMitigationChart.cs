// active-statuses lists). ActionId is what UseActionDetour's interception matches on --
// 0 is never intercepted, a safe placeholder. Radius only matters for SourceSide (the AoE
// centered on the caster, e.g. Reprisal's 5y). A press made OUTSIDE a scenario is the only
// trustworthy confirmation -- inside one, interception just echoes back the status id we
// told it to apply (see Hallowed Ground's Notes for how that went wrong once already).
// Percentages cross-checked against thebalanceffxiv.com (2026-09).

// Shield opts a no-Percent entry into interception anyway (real ability blocked, sim-only
// cooldown) -- without it, ByActionId's Percent filter would silently exclude it, letting
// the real ability fire and burn its real cooldown.

// A Shield entry's absorb size is exactly one of two mutually exclusive fields, both always
// a percentage of the CASTER's own max HP (every FFXIV shield scales off whoever cast it,
// not whoever catches it):
//   - ShieldPercentOfMaxHp: the tooltip states the size directly (Divine Veil 10%, etc.).
//   - ShieldPotency: only a potency number is given (e.g. Sentinel's 1000) -- this engine
//     can't convert that precisely (needs the caster's real stats), so TankShieldEstimate
//     below is a rough single-screenshot calibration, not a real formula.
// A caller converts the caster-relative percentage to absolute HP once, then re-expresses
// that as a fraction of EACH recipient's own max HP before banking it -- see
